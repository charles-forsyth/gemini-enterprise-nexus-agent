## 📈 Intelligence Trends (Last 50 Logs)
Here is an analysis of the recent interactions, identifying three key emerging themes and risks:

- **Risk: Google/Carahsoft Invoicing Freeze Blocking Research Pilots** 
A severe invoicing issue with Google and Carahsoft has forced a one-week pause on the creation of new sub-accounts. This administrative bottleneck is actively stalling research operations, most notably blocking the generation of the Billing ID required to launch the Godzik Lab Secure Enclave pilot.

- **Risk: Leadership Overrides Undermining Governance and Compliance** 
There is a documented instance of leadership (Mike Kennedy) bypassing the active "Project Polaris" provisioning freeze to expedite a Tier 1 GCP project for Inyoung Shin. Pushing this through despite unresolved PSSA terms and omitting Tier 2 billing warnings introduces significant compliance, financial, and security risks while setting a dangerous precedent for undocumented policy overrides.

- **Theme: Maturation of Secure Enclave and Strict Compliance Enforcement** 
Research Computing is rapidly standardizing its high-compliance infrastructure. This is evidenced by the rollout of new documentation (KB014-016), alignment with NIST 800-171 Rev 2 and CMMC Level 2 standards, and the introduction of mandatory training for PIs. Furthermore, the team is strictly enforcing Data Security Plan (DSP) approvals across multiple projects (Sensory Safari, ICPSR data, Meltzoff Lab) before provisioning any cloud or on-premise infrastructure.
